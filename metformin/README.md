With this script, we use `SIAMCAT` to recapitulate the analysis from
Forslund _et al._, which identified Metformin-treatment as a potential
confounder for Type II diabetes studies. The analysis includes:

* the variance decomposition analysis for Metformin
* an example plot for Enterobacteriacaea (specI cluster 95)
* the machine learning analysis similar to the one performed in
Forslund _et al._
