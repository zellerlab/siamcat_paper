For the reproduction of the results of Duvallet _et al._, I ran one job for
each dataset on the EMBL cluster. The script to run these jobs can be
found under `duvallet_reprod.R`.

The results of this analysis are saved in `results.txt`, which is then read to
plot the comparison with the values reported in the original paper.
