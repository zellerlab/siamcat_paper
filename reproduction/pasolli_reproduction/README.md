For the reproduction of the results of Pasolli _et al._, I ran one job for
each dataset on the EMBL cluster. The script to run these jobs can be
found under `fit_model_pasolli.R`.

The results of this analysis are saved in individual output files in the `out`
folder. To plot the comparison with the values reported in the original paper,
the individual results were copied to the `plot_reproduction.R` script (as
there were only a few jobs to consider).
